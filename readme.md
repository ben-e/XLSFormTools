# XLSFormTools

XLSFormTools is a package which, once completed, will allow a user to build XLSForms directly in R, navigate those forms with Shiny, and test those forms via a form of [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).

Right now this package consists of a set functions that are basically just wrappers over typical XLSForm functions. In the future I'd like to make this into a full embedded DSL for designing surveys.

This package is developed by Ben Ewing for the [DevLab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/).
